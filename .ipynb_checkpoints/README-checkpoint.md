# Goals:
 - Of New York Times Bestseller fiction and nonfiction books, which ones are picked up by streaming services as movies and TV shows? 
 - For this analysis, we used data from NYT Bestseller Lists (2008 - 2019), Netflix, and Hulu to classify whether or not bestselling books would be picked up by streaming services.
